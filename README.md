# Mafia-Bot
A Python bot for Telegram that hosts mafia games. Still a work in progress!

This script is quite simple, since it was only ever intended as a fun pastime for my friends and me; it's mostly here as a sample of what I do with my spare time. NOTE: The API token for the bot, as well as the ID numbers of my friends and our chat group, have been removed from the script for privacy reasons. You will NOT be able to run the script as it is presented here, but feel free to review the code.
